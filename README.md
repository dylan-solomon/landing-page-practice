# landing-page-practice

This is another practice website I created using flex. In this site I learned how to add a background to a site and add an overlay to it.

I also learned how to use flex: 1;, as I needed to evenly space boxes within a section of my site.

I further improved my knowledge of media queries on this site, adding a variety of queries to ensure spacing and sizing was accurate for various size screens.
